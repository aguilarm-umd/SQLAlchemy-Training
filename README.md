Learn how to use the SQLAlchemy python library for interacting with a relational database. Create a toy application which can perform these operations against both a SQLite and PostgreSQL database using the same set of code:
 * Initialize the database with at least two tables (linked in some way).
 * Populate the database with sample data
 * Query the database
 * Update the database

Use SQLAlchemy's expression language which is included in the core functionality, not the optional object-relational mapper (ORM) component. Learn SQLAlchemy version 1.3, as that is what patsy-db is currently using.

Track your toy application in a git repo at [https://github.com/aguilarm-umd.]  Use SSDR conventions for all git commits.
